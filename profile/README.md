BRASMOD is the first large-scale, open-access, tax-benefit microsimulation model for Brazil. Built within the EUROMOD software, our model encompasses the complete federal structure of taxes and benefits from 2008 to 2023, including the COVID-related benefits.

BRASMOD was developed in a joint effort of the Research Center on Macroeconomics of Inequalities ([MADE](https://madeusp.com.br/en/)) and the Public Sector Laboratory ([LabPub](https://labpub.fea.usp.br/)), both affiliated with the School of Economics, Business, Accounting and Actuarial at the University of São Paulo (FEA-USP).

**You can access the project website [here](https://brasmod.github.io/brasmod_main/).** 

The development of BRASMOD was supported by Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas (Fipe), Samambaia Filantropias, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, Open Society Foundations, and Hewlett Foundation.
